# veins_hetvnet #

Sample combination of Veins, INET, and SimuLTE.

Integrates code from the SimuLTE `cars` simulation as well as `AlertSender` and `AlertReceiver` code into a simulation that sends packets via both WLAN and LTE.

## Supported program versions ##

- Veins 5.0 (see <http://veins.car2x.org/>)
- OMNeT++ 5.5.1 (see <https://omnetpp.org/>)
- INET 3.6.6 (see <https://inet.omnetpp.org/>)
- SimuLTE 1.1.0 with Veins integration (git commit 825ea27) (see <http://simulte.com/>)

## Supported platforms ##

- Debian 9

## Setup ##

To quickly set things up, download "Instant Veins 5.0-alpha2-i1 with SimuLTE".
Or, follow below instructions.

First, make sure that you are using compatible program versions (see above) on a compatible platform (see above).
Store the above-mentioned software in the following paths:
- `~/src/veins`
- `~/src/omnetpp`
- `~/src/inet`
- `~/src/simulte`
- `~/src/veins_hetvnet` (this software)

Import all projects into the OMNeT++ IDE, making sure to also import the `veins_inet3` subproject stored in the `subprojects/veins_inet3` subfolder of the `veins` project.
Enable the `SimuLTE_Cars` feature of the SimuLTE OMNeT++ project.

Build all projects in both debug and release mode.

## Running ##

Try out `veins_hetvnet` by running the example in `examples/veins_hetvnet/omnetpp.ini`.

If you built the project on the command line (by running `./configure` followed by `make`) you can also run it as follows:

```
cd examples/veins_hetvnet
./run -d -u Cmdenv | grep "HetVNetDemoApp::handleMessage"
```

You should see the following output:

```
...
[TRACE] General:0 Highway.car[2].udpApp[0] HetVNetDemoApp::handleMessage - Packet received from WLAN interface: SeqNo[255] Delay[0.0001300217]
[TRACE] General:0 Highway.car[1].udpApp[0] HetVNetDemoApp::handleMessage - Packet received from WLAN interface: SeqNo[255] Delay[0.000130872022]
[TRACE] General:0 Highway.car[2].udpApp[0] HetVNetDemoApp::handleMessage - Packet received from LTE! interface: SeqNo[255] Delay[0.014]
...
```

That's it!
